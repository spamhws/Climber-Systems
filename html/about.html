            <span>The Beggining</span>
            We embarked on our journey by making a 5 HP agricultural Power
            Tiller. We were the first generation entrepreneurs and even though
            we had the knowledge, we didn’t have resources to fulfill our
            dream.In those days Agriculture was done in a traditional way and
            the farming community was not aware about the benefits of
            automation. Thus our first project received a lukewarm response but
            we didn’t lose hope.

            During that period we had an opportunity to work in sectors such as
            Pharmaceutical, Agriculture, Automation and Packaging. Until 2006,
            we only designed the machines; soon we began to manufacture them
            under the aegis of Climber Engineers which made customized machine
            design, manufacture and installment.

            To work towards offering customized design solutions to individual
            customers, a separate entity named Climbers systems was formed. We
            had an opportunity to work on a project initiated by the Bill Gates
            Foundation. They had asked over 70 institutes from all over the
            world to ‘Re-invent the toilet’. One of those institutes was Asian
            Institute of Technology, Thailand which had developed a technology
            based on the conditions set by the foundation; not to dig the soil,
            should be off-grid, reuse water and the effluents must be pathogen
            and odor free. However they needed someone to make the live model
            and approached us to make it. We made it in only 7 months which was
            a achievement and they were impressed by our work. The Head of Bill
            Gates Foundation, Bangladesh, Roshan Shreshtha, their Publicity Head
            Din Cattsand the head of world sanitation Dulai Kone visited our
            plant in Katraj, Pune. They wanted to meet us to confirm that such
            technology could be transformed in to reality.

            The Re-invented toilet that we built was exhibited in an Expo of
            Bill Gates Foundation and our name became significant as a company
            that can build a toilet which the Indian rural community needs most.
            Then we thought to ourselves; why not make it on a large scale? Thus
            we became the link between the technology and the end user of it.

            We realized that the sanitation requirements of the Indian rural
            community needed customized toilets which could be placed anywhere
            and which were mobile. To fulfill this need, we formed a separate
            company called Climber Enviro Solutions works in the sanitation as
            well as waste management sector. Plastic waste is one of the biggest
            threats to our environment. We built a machine by using a technology
            and produced Diesel from it which gave us an output of 85%.
            Scientists can develop a technology but Climber Enviro Solutions
            enables them to use it to make customized machines. Thus more
            scientists approached us to build customized machines based on their
            technology.

            Vigyan Ashram, an NGO had made a prototype of Rice De-Husking
            machine. We took this as a challenge and based on our design, we
            built a machine. Often building a machine on a large scale on a
            prototype is a tough task; after all, we had to make a fully
            operative and finished product from it. It involved selecting the
            correct material, perfect assembly and making it easy to operate. We
            observed that a farmer doesn’t require big machinery for his farm;
            what he needs is smaller machine that will give maximum output. In
            fact such small machines could start a revolution in the smaller
            pockets of India and develop future entrepreneurs who can become
            self sufficient. Thus we made our first Rice de-husking machine
            which gave us a vision that if we provide them to the farmers and
            self help groups, it would make value addition to their lives. The
            Rice De-Husking machine was launched, but we didn’t stop at only
            building it. We acquired a certification of Indian Council of
            Agricultural Research (ICAR) for this machine, so the farmers could
            get subsidy to purchase it. This machine has a subsidy of 50% all
            over India. Thus our journey of design, manufacturing and takingit
            to the farmer was fulfilled. Our new Groundnut peeling machine can
            peel allied lentils also. We are working on a Rice Thresher which
            will separate Rice from its cover. This year we plan to bring a
            series of such Agriculture centric machines.
