            <span>The Beggining</span>
            We embarked on our journey by making a 5 HP agricultural Power
            Tiller. We were the first generation entrepreneurs and even though
            we had the knowledge, we didn’t have resources to fulfill our dream.
            In those days Agriculture was done in a traditional way and the
            farming community was not aware about the benefits of automation.
            Thus our first project received a lukewarm response but we didn’t
            lose hope.

            During that period we had an opportunity to work in sectors such as
            Pharmaceutical, Agriculture, Automation and Packaging. Until 2006,
            we only designed the machines; soon we began to manufacture them
            under the aegis of Climber Engineers which made customized machine
            design, manufacture and installment.

            To work towards offering customized design solutions to individual
            customers, a separate entity named Climbers systems was formed. We
            had an opportunity to work on a project initiated by the Bill Gates
            Foundation. They had asked over 70 institutes from all over the
            world to ‘Re-invent the toilet’. One of those institutes was Asian
            Institute of Technology, Thailand which had developed a technology
            and they needed someone to make the live model and approached us. We
            copmpleted the build in only 7 months which was an achievement.

            The Re-invented toilet that we built was exhibited in an Expo of
            Bill Gates Foundation and our name became significant as a company
            that can build a toilet which the Indian rural community needs most.
            Then we thought to ourselves; why not make it on a large scale? Thus
            we became the link between the technology and the end user of it.

            We realized that the sanitation requirements of the Indian rural
            community needed customized toilets which could be placed anywhere
            and which were mobile. To fulfill this need, we formed a separate
            company: Climber Enviro Solutions works in the sanitation as well as
            waste management sector. Plastic waste is one of the biggest threats
            to our environment. We built a machine by using a technology and
            produced Diesel from it which gave us an output of 85%. Scientists
            can develop a technology, but Climber Enviro Solutions enables them
            to use it to make customized machines. Thus more scientists
            approached us to build customized machines based on their
            technology.

            <span>Rice De-Husking Machine</span>
            Vigyan Ashram, an NGO had made a prototype of Rice De-Husking
            machine. We took this as a challenge and based on our design, we
            built a machine. Often building a machine on a large scale on a
            prototype is a tough task; after all, we had to make a fully
            operative and finished product from it. It involved selecting the
            correct material, perfect assembly and making it easy to operate. We
            observed that a farmer doesn’t require big machinery for his farm;
            what he needs is smaller machine that will give maximum output. In
            fact such small machines could start a revolution in the smaller
            pockets of India and develop future entrepreneurs who can become
            self-sufficient. Thus we made our first Rice de-husking machine
            which gave us a vision that if we provide them to the farmers and
            self help groups, it would make value addition to their lives. The
            Rice De-Husking machine was launched, but we didn’t stop at only
            building it. We acquired a certification of Indian Council of
            Agricultural Research (ICAR) for this machine, so the farmers could
            get subsidy to purchase it. This machine has a subsidy of 50% all
            over India. Thus our journey of design, manufacturing and takingit
            to the farmer was fulfilled. Our new Groundnut peeling machine can
            peel allied lentils also. We are working on a Rice Thresher which
            will separate Rice from its cover. This year we plan to bring a
            series of such Agriculture centric machines.

        <h2>Our vision for the future</h2>
        <p>
          As the great Mahatma Gandhi said, India lives in the villages and we
          aim to make the lives of Rural India worthwhile.
          <br />
          <br />
          In today’s knowledge-driven economy, innovation is the primary driver
          of progress. For innovation to blossom, ideas must be funded, so they
          can be taken to market. Without capital, even the most path-breaking
          ideas could be forced to terminate before they can take wings.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our vision for the future is to work on projects that enable
          entrepreneurs to foray into their own business avenues. The Government
          of India has initiated various Government schemes that could benefit
          SME’s, small units, village governing bodies, self help groups and
          individuals and we are ready to support them with our range of
          customized designs and products.
          <br />
          <br />
          Corporate companies are engaged in CSR activities such as rural
          development, adoption of villages, environment protection by
          maintaining quality of air, water and soil and many more. We plan to
          support them with our innovative products.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our entrepreneurial spirit has to be kept alive and ticking, for which
          we need encouragement that will trigger an entrepreneurial avalanche.
          Our aim is to transform the lives of the rural Indian community by
          providing sustainable solutions and take India on the fast track of
          growth.
